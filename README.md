## Description of Dataset
Our dataset has comprehensive records of U.S. wildfires documented by the US Forest Service. The dataset contains information on wildfire incidents across the United States, capturing fires from various years and regions, which makes it one of the largest public records on wildfire activity. It provides precise location data using latitude and longitude coordinates, along with timestamps for when the fire was discovered and, in some cases, when it was contained. It has variables related to cause, size, location, and timing. The dataset allows for geospatial mapping, trend analysis over time, and studying patterns in wildfire behavior and management strategies. The main columns of data include *uniquefireID*, the identifier, *fireyear* which is the year the fire occurred, *firename*, *totalacres* aka the acres burned by the fire, *statcause* which is the stated cause of the fire, *discoverydatetime* and *fireoutdatetime* which is time stamp data of when the fire was first recorded and when it was contained, *latdd83* and *longdd83* which are the geographic coordinates of the fire, *sizeclass* the classification code based on the fire size, and lastly *owneragency* and *protectionagency* which represent the agencies responsible for the land and fire response. Overall, this dataset is useful for the various fire and aviation agencies that utilize fire occurrence data for management purposes.

## Question 1
Question: How does the average acreage burned by wildfires vary by cause and across different regions, and where are fires the most destructive?

Importance: Through this question, we are able to identify the most dangerous causes of fires and equip agencies with the knowledge of specific behaviors and conditions which lead to larger fires. This can result in policy changes if equipment use is a leading cause, or if public use is not regulated enough, along with many other causes. Using analysis like our own, they can present data behind these new laws and give agencies the evidence needed to more effectively allocate their funding and resources to target more dangerous fires. It is also a measure for fire mitigation if they can develop more effective preventive measures for certain causes.
