## Description of Dataset
Our dataset has comprehensive records of U.S. wildfires documented by the US Forest Service. The dataset contains information on wildfire incidents across the United States, capturing fires from various years and regions which makes it one of the largest public records on wildfire activity. It provides precise location data using latitude and longitude coordinates, along with timestamps for when the fire was discovered and, in some cases, when it was contained. It has variables related to cause, size, location, and timing. The dataset allows for geospatial mapping, trend analysis over time, and studying patterns in wildfire behavior and management strategies. Overall, it's a vital asset for various fire and aviation staff to monitor and manage fires across the country.
